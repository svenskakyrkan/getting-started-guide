Before running this code, you need to register with the Church of Sweden API portal and generate an API key.

You then need to paste your API key into the static field API_KEY in the file core/src/main/java/se/svenskakyrkan/android/core/place/HttpUrlConnectionPlaceFinder.java.

See ../README.MD for instructions about generating an API key.

Use Gradle to build, using the command "gradle build".
